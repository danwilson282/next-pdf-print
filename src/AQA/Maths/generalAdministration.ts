Therefore our qualifications must assess a wide range of competences.</p><p>The subject criteria have been assessed to see if any of the skills or knowledge required present any possible difficulty to any students, whatever their ethnic background, religion, sex, age, disability or sexuality. If any difficulties were encountered, the criteria were reviewed again to make sure that tests of specific competences were only included if they were important to the subject.</p><p>As members of the Joint Council for Qualifications (JCQ) we participate in the production of the JCQ document <em>Access Arrangements and Reasonable Adjustments: General and Vocational qualifications</em> .
